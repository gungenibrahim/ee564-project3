%% STARTING VALUES
% For this design, I aimed premium efficiency class because motor consumes
% high energy. It saturates %95.8 efficiency for high energy motors. Then, 
% target efficiency is chosen %96.

%% Main Dimensions
% In this part, inner diameter and length of the machine will calculate. In
% order to achive this Cmech(machine constant) should be detected according 
%to calculated power per pole.

% Product of inner_diameter^2 and length of the motor can be calculated from 
% power and machine constant Cmech. 
% Pmech = Cmech*D^2*l'*nsync;
% Also, aspect ratio should be calculated for decide dimensions.
% Aspect ratio can be calculated following formula for asynchronous machines  
% x = pi*(pole_pair^(1/3))/(2*pole_pair), x = Di/L.

D2L = P_rated/(Cmech* f_syn);

Aspect_Ratio= pi*(Npole_pair^(1/3))/(2*Npole_pair);

fprintf('di^2*L is %g\n ',D2L);
fprintf('Aspect ratio is %g\n', Aspect_Ratio);
%%
% L_machine = Aspect_Ratio * D_machine
%%
%%
% Di^2*L is equal to the 1.66 and aspect ratio is 0.31. Also aspect ratio
% is equal to the  0.62. From previous parameters(D2L and aspect ratio),
% inner diameter and length of machine can be calculated.

% Moreover, outer diameter is calculated according to following table, which
% is generalized the outer diameter towards to the number of pole. Outer diameter
% coefficiend is decreasing when number of pole increase because magnetic
% flux density at the yoke decrease propotionally.

%=================================> Do tablosunu ekle !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

M_outer_diameter = 1.66*M_inner_diameter;

fprintf('Inner diameter is  %g\n m ',M_inner_diameter);
fprintf('Outer diameter is  %g\n m ',M_outer_diameter);


fprintf('Machine length is  %g\n m',M_length);

%%
% After decide the main dimensions, we should check it with tangential(shear)
% stress. It shold an interval which is specified folloing table.

fprintf('Shear stress is  %g\n Kpa',Shear_stress);

%% Airgap
%%
% After deciding main dimensions of the motor, airgap should be decided
% according to magnetical, electrical and mechanical properties. There is
% a trade-off between them. Acording to mechanical properties airgap shoul
% be maximize to rotate the machine smootly. Therefore, according to
% electromagnetical properties, it should be minimize to make power
% transfer more.

% Following figure shows that general airgap equations of asyncronuous machines

% ========>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>airgap formullerini ekle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%%
airgap = (0.18 + 0.006*P_rated^0.4)/1000;

fprintf('Airgap is  %g\n m ',airgap);

%% Winding Selection
%%
% In this part of the project, number of slots of rotor and stator and
% winding factors of higher harmonics are calculated.
