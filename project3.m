%% EE564 DESIGN OF ELECTRICAL MACHINES
% PROJECT 3 - TRACTION MOTOR DESIGN


%% INTRODUCTION
% In this project, traction asynchronous squirrel cage induction motor 
%(with copper rotor-bars) is designed. Then, designed motor will be analyzed 
% with FEM program. Specificitions of the generator as follows,

% * Rated Power Output: 1280 kW
% * Line-to-line voltage: 1350 V
% * Number of poles: 6
% * Rated Speed: 1520 rpm (72 km/h) (driven with 78 Hz inverter)
% * Rated Motor Torque: 7843 Nm
% * Cooling: Forced Air Cooling
% * Insulating Class: 200C
% * Train Wheel Diameter: 1210 mm
% * Maximum Speed: 140 km/h
% * Gear Ratio: 4.82

% Design steps at below will be followed at this design.
